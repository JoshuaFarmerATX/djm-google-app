Gene Kerley, master carpenter and former president of one of America’s top 50 builder companies, has joined forces with his builder son to form Kerley Family Homes. Gene and Joe Kerley share a lifelong passion for building value-packed homes in prestigious neighborhoods around metro Atlanta. Their commitment to family values and meeting home buyers’ needs leads them to form individual relationships with each buyer.

Now in the business for 20 years, Joe has always wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps. He spent the summers of his teen years working around job sites as a laborer, and his career progressed until he eventually became a superintendent managing multiple subdivisions. Most recently, he owned a contracting company where he ran a crew of 60 carpenters and 15 siding contractors.

Together, the duo brings a level of expertise and keen eye for details that can be seen in all homes built by Kerley Family Homes. Before emerging home trends are offered by other builders in the Atlanta new home market, Kerley Family Homes offers these as standard features, making their homes unique for buyers. Their careful, up-close business management reduces overhead expenses, allowing Kerley Family Homes to provide value-packed homes with the most up-to-date features on the market."
